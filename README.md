# JavaLambdaDemo

Instructions for Building and Deploying
Building the Project

Create all the files as shown above in the described directory structure.
Open a command prompt and navigate to the root directory of your project:
cd path\to\JavaLambdaDemo

Build the project with Gradle:
gradlew clean build shadowJar
This will create a JAR file at build/libs/JavaLambdaDemo.jar

Testing Locally
You can test the Lambda function locally before deploying:

Create a test JSON file named test-event.json with the following content:
json{
"name": "LocalTest"
}

Run the main method in your Handler class:
gradlew run


Deploying with AWS CLI and CloudFormation

Make sure you have AWS CLI installed and configured with appropriate credentials.
Package your CloudFormation template:
aws cloudformation package --template-file template.yaml --s3-bucket YOUR_S3_BUCKET --output-template-file packaged-template.yaml
Replace YOUR_S3_BUCKET with an S3 bucket you have access to.
Deploy the CloudFormation stack:
aws cloudformation deploy --template-file packaged-template.yaml --stack-name java-lambda-demo --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM


Testing the Lambda Function
Using AWS CLI:

Create a test event file named invoke-event.json:
json{
"name": "CLI Test"
}

Invoke the Lambda function:
aws lambda invoke --function-name JavaLambdaDemo --payload file://invoke-event.json --cli-binary-format raw-in-base64-out response.json

Check the response:
type response.json


Using AWS Console:

Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the Lambda service.
Find your function named "JavaLambdaDemo" and click on it.
Click the "Test" tab.
Create a new test event with the following JSON:
json{
"name": "Console Test"
}

Click "Test" to execute the function and view the results.

Important Notes

Make sure the --cli-binary-format raw-in-base64-out parameter is included when invoking from CLI to avoid base64 encoding issues with the JSON payload.
The Lambda function uses a simple Map<String, Object> as the input type rather than APIGateway request/response events, as requested.
The org.json library is used for JSON formatting, as specified.
The project uses Java 11 and the shadowJar Gradle plugin to create an uber-JAR with all dependencies included.
The mainClass is specified in the build.gradle file.
